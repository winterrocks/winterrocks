## üìÇ Posts about Open Source License issues remediation ideas
Below are a bit older but still valid posts about ideas on how to remediate Open Source Licensing issues. The posts were originally done on LinkedIn, but they are now buried under many other posts, so difficult to find. 
- [CC-BY-SA snippets remediation ideas](oss_licensing_posts/cc_by_sa_snippet_remediation_ideas.md)
- [Embedded GPL (and other copyleft) component remediation ideas](oss_licensing_posts/embedded_gpl_remediation_ideas.md)
- [GPL licensed components remediation ideas](oss_licensing_posts/gpl_remediation_ideas.md)
- [LGPL licensed components remediation ideas](oss_licensing_posts/lgpl_issues_remediation_ideas.md)
- [No license component remediation ideas](oss_licensing_posts/no_license_remediation_ideas.md)

As a bonus, there was also a post about Linux Kernel Loadable Modules (KLM) a.k.a. Loadable Kernel Modules (LKM):
- [Are KLMs GPL or not?](oss_licensing_posts/klm_gpl_or_not.md)

üëç I also encourage people to check the original LinkedIn posts because there are some very good comments from some of the industry leaders. 

## üì´ How to reach me:
- Email is most likely the best way
- I'm also happy to get linked on LinkedIn, but please send me a note why we should be linked
  - https://www.linkedin.com/in/jarikoivisto/

## üòÑ Pronouns:
- h√§n/he/him

## ‚ö° Fun fact:
- Obviously, I'm not a great snowboarder :snowboarder:, but I still do it. Injuries so far:
  - Broken ribs many times
  - Dislocated shoulder x 4 and shoulder has been operated x 2 now:
    - The 1<sup>st</sup> operation was [Bankart repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankart_repair) and the 2<sup>nd</sup> operation was [Latarjet bone block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latarjet_procedure)
- The music I listen tends to be on the harder side of the spectrum: (melodic) death metal, thrash metal, doom metal, black metal, ... I guess that you got the point üòÑ
