# Components without any license: ideas on how to remediate

In the series of how to remediate open source SW issues, let's discuss what are the options when a component without any license is found in the audit. 

Note, one has no right to use a component or snippet of someone else's work if there is no license, this license can be a commercial license or an open source license (or of course the work may be put in public domain too).

Typically one finds these components or snippets without any license from GitHub, blog posts, etc.

Some remediation options to consider:
1. Contact the copyright owner and ask if she/he can add a license. Even better if the license added is a permissive one, e.g. MIT or Apache license.
     - Often times the idea of the code owner was that the code is under some permissive license or is in public domain.
1. Contact the copyright owner and ask if it is o.k. to use the code in commercial product. Possibly ask if you can purchase a commercial license.
    - Get this permission in written (email normally o.k.)
1. Remove and rewrite
