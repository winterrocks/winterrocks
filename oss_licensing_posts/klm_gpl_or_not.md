# Kernel Loadable Modules: are those GPLv2 or not

Let's discuss a bit about Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs), a.k.a. Kernel Loadable Modules (KLMs) and what is the license of these. From what I have read over the years it seems obvious that FSF opinion is that KLMs are under GPLv2, but at the same time Linus Torvalds has a bit more mixed opinion, but it seems that for most cases his opinion is also that KLMs should be under GPLv2, but that there can be some cases when this general rule does not apply.

But since there is no case law existing at the moment (AFAIK) the question if KLMs are GPL or non-GPL is still to be discussed.

It would be great to see some discussion about KLMs and the license issues.
